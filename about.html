        <p>
          Hello! My name is Rodny Delena, and I am an aspiring Software
          Engineer. I am a Filipino immigrant who moved to Texas 20+ years ago.
          I am also a medical professional who has worked in the healthcare
          setting for 9 years. I decided to pick up a new skill in programming
          because I was inspired by family and friends who work in the
          interesting, everchanging tech field.

          A little bit about me, I love animals! The dog in the picture is Koba.
          She is an exceptionally girl. Another bit about me is I love to paint
          and create art. Painting became a hobby after I took an art class in
          college. Somehow all the stress from deadlines & school faded away
          when you're in the zone and making art. I am still an amateur and
          would love to practice more in the future.
